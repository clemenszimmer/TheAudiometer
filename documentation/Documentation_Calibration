The Calibration consists of:

1) Dummy head should be put in an isolate room of total silence. 
2) Sennheiser HDA 200 Headphones should be positioned in both his ears. 
3) Set frequency (250 Herz) in a defined volume (gain = 0) in only one side (left side).
4) Record sound for 10s in Acqua Software. Define scale of octave band (for each frequency) and also set in Acqua. 
5) Press Ctrl+L in Acqua to get the loudness level equivalent to the frequency
6) Set a table with loudnessesâ€™ thresholds (dB SPL) for human normal hearing levels based on professional audiograms.
7) Compare the value obtained in (5) to value in (6).
8) If (5) and (6) differ, adjust the volume of the laptop (of the speakers), until both values are practically the same.
9) Press right arrow (increase gain) and repeat procedure until gain reaches 1.
10) After gain reaches 1 for one frequency, press up arrow(to go to next frequency) and press left arrow until gain reaches 0.
11) Repeat procedure until are frequencies until 16kHz are tested.
